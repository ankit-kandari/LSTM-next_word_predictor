# LSTM-next_word_predictor

This project uses 36,000 words(or a section of one of the 3 lotr books) from The Lord of the Rings for educational/practice purposes only.
I believe this use falls under fair use due to its non-commercial nature and limited scope and I attribute the text to J.R.R. Tolkien and respect the copyright holder's rights.
